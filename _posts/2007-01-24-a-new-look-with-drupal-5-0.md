You may have noticed a change on ArminSadeghi.com. Last night the site was upgraded to use the new Drupal 5.0. Drupal is the content management software I use to run the site. Along with the upgrade there is a whole new theme in place providing a fresh look.

The upgrade went smoothly and I was able to put the site all back within an hour. If you are in a similar position I would recommend upgrading. There is a good video tour of the new features here, and upgrading info here. The most important step is, of course, to back up your site first.
