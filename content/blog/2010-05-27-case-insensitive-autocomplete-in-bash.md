I use auto complete on the command line all the time to avoid having to type the full name of a file. Love it. What I hate is how it&#8217;s case-sensitive in bash, so I can&#8217;t do `cd ~/desk` to go to the `~/Desktop` folder.

The fix for this is to use the shell input options file **.inputrc**

Just set this one option and restart your shell:

```bash
echo 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> ~/.inputrc
```

If you happen to have a system wide inputrc settings (`/etc/inputrc`) and want itÂ included then you should add the following to your .inputrc file:

```
$include /etc/inputrc
```
